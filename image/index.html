 <p style="color:black">Sexual harassment is an offensive crime against human rights. The Policy on Sexual Exploitation and Abuses (SEA) is made to ensure the prevention and response to sexual harassment at Bangladesh Army International University of Science and Technology (BAIUST). The policy is non-specific for male and female.
Several sections in the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, however, provide for guarantees of gender equality. The state is firmly committed to removing all forms of gender discrimination and, as the Constitution states that women have the same rights as men in the state and public life. All citizens are equal before the law, and have an equal right to have protection under law.
Hence BAIUST authority has a duty to adopt effective measures to prevent and deter offences of sexual violence and harassment in the workplace of the University. Special attention will be given to the female students and any case of exploitation that is done for personal interest. Also this university has a sense of duty to seek protection of relevant laws for trial of offences of sexual harassment and to take necessary steps..</P></td>
